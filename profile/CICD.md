# CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery)

Modern embedded software development requires automated workflows that ensure code quality, enable rapid iteration, and support collaborative development. CI/CD practices bring these capabilities to embedded systems, helping teams deliver reliable firmware faster while maintaining high quality standards.

[MDK](https://www.keil.arm.com/keil-mdk/) includes tools to establish comprehensive CI/CD workflows that include [automated builds](#automated-build-test) as well as unit testing and integration testing on [simulation models](#arm-fixed-virtual-platforms-fvp) or [target hardware](#hil-testing-with-pyocd). [Keil Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.keil-studio-pack) is based on VS Code that integrates Git features and offers several VS Code extensions for static code analysis. The [CMSIS-Toolbox](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/) is a command-line interface for building embedded applications, enabling seamless integration with popular CI/CD platforms (like GitHub Actions). Integration with static code analysis tools (e.g. MISRA checking) is achieved with standard database files that third-party tools can consume.

![CI/CD Process Overview](CICD_Overview.png "CI/CD Process Overview")

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) execute build or test jobs on runners. A `*.yml` file in a `.github/workflows` directory of a repository defines a set of tasks such as building and testing pull requests.

The repositories on [github.com/Arm-Examples](https://github.com/Arm-Examples) use topics to label:

- [cicd](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Acicd+org%3AArm-Examples+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories) – repository with automated workflows.
- [simulation](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Asimulation+org%3AArm-Examples+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories) – repository with test on simulation.
- [hardware](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ahardware+org%3AArm-Examples+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories) – repository with test on hardware target.

[Arm-Software/cmsis-actions](https://github.com/ARM-software/cmsis-actions) are reusable workflows that let you install tools and active software licenses. Use the instructions of these actions to enable other CI/CD systems such as Azure DevOps or GitLab.

## CI/CD Capabilities for Embedded Development

The underlying build system of [Keil Studio](https://www.keil.arm.com/) uses the [CMSIS-Toolbox](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/) and CMake. [GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners) provide virtual machines for automated build and execution tests using simulation models, while [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) enable testing on actual target hardware. [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) is streamlined with:

- Consistent tool installation based on a single [`vcpkg-configuration.json`](https://github.com/Arm-Examples/Hello_World/blob/main/vcpkg-configuration.json) file for desktop and CI environments.
- CMSIS solution files (`*.csolution.yml`) that enable seamless builds in CI, for example using GitHub actions.
- [Run and Debug Configuration](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/build-overview/#run-and-debug-configuration) for pyOCD that uses a single configuration file `*.cbuild-run.yml`.

### Automated Build Test

The [CMSIS-Toolbox](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/) enables reproducible builds across different environments using the *csolution project* files that define build configurations, dependencies, and target devices. Build automation ensures that every code change is validated consistently, catching integration issues early.

### Automated Execution Test

Effective embedded development incorporates various testing strategies:

- **Unit testing** where code is tested primarily at function level using a test framework like Unity.
- **Integration testing** where multiple components are combined and interfaces between these components are verified.
- **System testing** where the complete system is tested against the requirements.

[MDK](https://www.keil.arm.com/keil-mdk/) supports unit testing and integration testing on target systems with:

- **Arm Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVP)** are simulation models to test without physical devices, accelerating feedback cycles.
- **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Testing** with debug adapters to execute tests on actual target hardware to verify real-world behavior.

CI pipelines may store build artifact files, reports, and may further automate firmware packaging, versioning, and deployment processes, ensuring traceability from source code to deployed binaries.

## Arm Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVP)

[Arm FVPs](https://arm-software.github.io/AVH/main/simulation/html/index.html) are functionally accurate simulation models of Arm-based Cortex-M CPUs and Corstone-3xx subsystems. [Virtual Interfaces](https://arm-software.github.io/AVH/main/simulation/html/group__arm__cmvp.html) in Arm FVPs implement various CPU peripherals that allow to use external resources for stimulating the firmware application. Several virtual interfaces connect to Python for flexible scripting in test automation.

## HIL Testing with pyOCD

[Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware-in-the-loop_simulation) testing is enabled with [self-hosted GitHub runners](RPI_GH_Runner.md) that connect to Linux systems equipped with debug probes. Build artifacts (firmware images) are generated through automated build tests on GitHub-hosted runners, then deployed to self-hosted runners where pyOCD downloads the firmware to target hardware and executes the test suite.

## Setup of Raspberry Pi as Self-Hosted GitHub Runner

Raspberry Pi devices can serve as cost-effective self-hosted GitHub runners for HIL testing with embedded hardware. The setup involves installing Ubuntu Server, configuring the development toolchain, and registering the device as a GitHub Actions runner.

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi 3 or newer (Arm64 architecture).
- microSD card (minimum 16 GB).
- Network connection (LAN or Wi-Fi).
- Debug probe (e.g. ULINKplus or ST-LINK) for target hardware connection.

### Setup Steps

The setup requires four steps:

1. [Create microSD card image for Raspberry Pi](#1-create-microsd-card-image-for-raspberry-pi)
2. [Configure network access](#2-configure-network-access)
3. [Install development tools](#3-install-development-tools)
4. [Setup GitHub runner](#4-setup-github-runner)

#### 1. Create microSD Card Image for Raspberry Pi

- Use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software) to install Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (64-bit).
- Configure hostname (e.g., `rpi-ci`), user credentials, SSH access, and network settings during the imaging process.
  See [Ubuntu installation guide for Raspberry Pi](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi).

#### 2. Configure Network Access

Configure your network access and establish SSH connection for remote management.

```bash
# Determine the Raspberry Pi's MAC address (useful for network registration)
ip link show eth0 | grep ether

# Determine the assigned IP address
ip addr show eth0 | grep inet
```

If your organization requires device registration (e.g., MAC address whitelisting), register the Raspberry Pi's MAC
address with your network administrator before proceeding.

**Connect via SSH from your PC:**

```bash
# Replace <ip-address> with your Raspberry Pi's IP address
ssh <username>@<ip-address>

# Example:
# ssh devuser@192.168.1.100
```

#### 3. Install Development Tools

You'll need the following tools:

- [CMSIS-Toolbox](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/releases) for building embedded projects
- [pyOCD](https://github.com/pyocd/pyOCD/releases) for debug probe support
- Required packs (e.g., `Keil::STM32H5xx_DFP`) using `cpackget`

Also, you need to configure the following:

- Configure environment variables (`CMSIS_TOOLBOX_ROOT`, `CMSIS_PACK_ROOT`) in `.bashrc`
- Configure USB access with the [udev rules for pyOCD](https://github.com/pyocd/pyOCD/tree/main/udev) to enable
  non-root access to debug probes. Add user to `plugdev` group.

Copy and paste the following commands to setup CMSIS-Toolbox, pyOCD, and required packs. Adapt the versions and DFP
pack as required for your application.

```bash
# Install build tools
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install cmake ninja-build unzip -y

# Download and extract CMSIS-Toolbox
wget https://artifacts.tools.arm.com/cmsis-toolbox/2.12.0/cmsis-toolbox-linux-arm64.tar.gz
tar -xf cmsis-toolbox-linux-arm64.tar.gz

# Download and extract pyOCD
wget https://github.com/pyocd/pyOCD/releases/download/v0.42.0/pyocd-linux-arm64-0.42.0.zip
mkdir pyocd && cd pyocd
unzip ./../pyocd-linux-arm64-0.42.0.zip
cd ..

# Set up environment variables (persist across reboots)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/pyocd:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/cmsis-toolbox-linux-arm64/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export CMSIS_PACK_ROOT="$HOME/packs"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Install udev rules for Debug Adapter (enables non-root USB access)
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyocd/pyOCD/main/udev/49-stlinkv3.rules -O /etc/udev/rules.d/49-stlinkv3.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger

# Add user to plugdev group
sudo usermod -aG plugdev $USER

# Verify installation
pyocd --version
cpackget --version

# Initialize pack repository and install STM32H5xx DFP
cpackget init https://www.keil.com/pack/index.pidx
cpackget add Keil::STM32H5xx_DFP@2.1.1 -a
```

#### 4. Setup GitHub Runner

Follow [GitHub's self-hosted runner setup](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners)
for Linux Arm64. Download the runner package, configure it with your repository URL and token, then start the runner
service with `./run.sh`.

**To add a self-hosted runner:**

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository **Settings** → **Actions** → **Runners**
2. Click **New self-hosted runner**
3. Select **Linux** and **ARM64** architecture
4. Follow the instructions provided by GitHub (the commands will include a unique authentication token for your repository)

Copy and paste the following commands to download and configure the GitHub runner:

```bash
# Create a folder for the runner
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner

# Download the latest runner package (check GitHub for current version)
curl -o actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.331.0.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.331.0/actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.331.0.tar.gz

# Optional: Validate the hash (compare with the hash shown on GitHub)
echo "f5863a211241436186723159a111f352f25d5d22711639761ea24c98caef1a9a  actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.331.0.tar.gz" | shasum -a 256 -c

# Extract the installer
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.331.0.tar.gz

# Configure the runner (replace with your repository URL and token from GitHub)
./config.sh --url https://github.com/<your-org>/<your-repo> --token <YOUR_TOKEN>

# Start the runner
./run.sh
```

Once started, the runner will listen for jobs. When you trigger a workflow in your repository that uses
`runs-on: self-hosted`, the Raspberry Pi will execute the job.
